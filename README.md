# HeartDisease-prediction-R-
In the whole Data analysis process we have get insights of Heart Disease dataset and find the corelations between different features who helped to predict which feature is significant for the Heart disease prediction. And we concluded that higher blood pressure, Lower blood pressure Alcoholic value smoking ratio are the most significant variables.

# Model Implementation:
## 1.Logistic Regression Model



Logistic Regression is a classification model that usually was used in Biology field. Logistic Regression is compatible for dependent variables.
For example,
Predicting email is spam or not
Consider a situation in which we need to distinguish whether the email is spam or not. If we apply line deflection to this problem, there is a need to set a limit depending on what segmentation can be made. State whether the actual category is negative, In this example, it can be proved that the reversal of the line is not suitable for the problem of separation. The rotation of the line is infinite, and this brings the order of things into the image. Their value ranges from 0 to 1.
This is a classification algorithm in the domain of supervised learning that used to classify binary class and multiclass classification and in our case we have to classify in binary form if any patient have disease or not and this is calculated using likelihood probabilistic value.
